      <b>A website</b> (also written as a <b>web site</b>) is any <span class="text-pink">web page</span> whose content
      is identified by a common <span class="text-pink">domain name</span> and is published on at least one
      <span class="text-pink">web server.</span>
      Websites are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose, such as news, education, commerce,
      entertainment, or <span class="text-pink">social media. Hyperlinking</span> between web pages guides the
      navigation of the site, which often starts with a <span class="text-pink">home page.</span> The
      <span class="text-pink">most-visited</span> sites are <span class="text-pink">Google, YouTube</span>, and
      <span class="text-pink">Facebook.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      All publicly-accessible websites collectively constitute the <span class="text-pink">World Wide Web.</span> There
      are also <span class="text-pink">private websites</span> that can only be accessed on a private network, such as a
      company's internal website for its employees. Users can access websites on a range of devices, including
      <span class="text-pink">desktops, laptops, tablets,</span> and <span class="text-pink">smartphones.</span> The <span class="text-pink">app
      used on these devices is called a <span class="text-pink">web browser</span>.
